# tencentcloud_instance

Provides a CVM instance resource.

~> **NOTE:** You can launch an CVM instance for a VPC network via specifying parameter `vpc_id`. One instance can only belong to one VPC.

~> **NOTE:** At present, 'PREPAID' instance cannot be deleted and must wait it to be outdated and released automatically.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "tencentcloud_images" "my_favorate_image" {
  image_type = ["PUBLIC_IMAGE"]
  os_name    = "centos"
}

data "tencentcloud_instance_types" "my_favorate_instance_types" {
  filter {
    name   = "instance-family"
    values = ["S3"]
  }

  cpu_core_count = 1
  memory_size    = 1
}

data "tencentcloud_availability_zones" "my_favorate_zones" {
}

// Create VPC resource
resource "tencentcloud_vpc" "app" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  name       = "awesome_app_vpc"
}

resource "tencentcloud_subnet" "app" {
  vpc_id            = "${tencentcloud_vpc.app.id}"
  availability_zone = "${data.tencentcloud_availability_zones.my_favorate_zones.zones.0.name}"
  name              = "awesome_app_subnet"
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

// Create 2 CVM instances to host awesome_app
resource "tencentcloud_instance" "my_awesome_app" {
  instance_name              = "awesome_app"
  availability_zone          = "${data.tencentcloud_availability_zones.my_favorate_zones.zones.0.name}"
  image_id                   = "${data.tencentcloud_images.my_favorate_image.images.0.image_id}"
  instance_type              = "${data.tencentcloud_instance_types.my_favorate_instance_types.instance_types.0.instance_type}"
  system_disk_type           = "CLOUD_PREMIUM"
  system_disk_size           = 50
  hostname                   = "user"
  project_id                 = 0
  vpc_id                     = "${tencentcloud_vpc.app.id}"
  subnet_id                  = "${tencentcloud_subnet.app.id}"
  internet_max_bandwidth_out = 20
  count                      = 2

  data_disks {
    data_disk_type = "CLOUD_PREMIUM"
    data_disk_size = 50
  }

  tags = {
    tagKey = "tagValue"
  }
}
```
